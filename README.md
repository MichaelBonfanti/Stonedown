# Stonedown
Markdown Editor for iPhone and iPad

# Project Description
Stonedwon will be my first serious project to learn how to program Apps for iPhone and iPad, I know it is a complicated project for a newbie and I could make sure something simpler. This will be a long wait before I can share even a first version of testing since I will have to learn a lot of things, it will be hard but slowly there is something to do.

# Roadmap
- Creating and opening .md files
- iCloud sync support and the Apple Files app
- Collaborate with other users to create .md files
- Preview the .md file before it is published

# Update
Coming Soon...
